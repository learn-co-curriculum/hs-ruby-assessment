![ruby](http://media2.giphy.com/media/12jdalMQkt7iM/200.gif)

Time to review your Ruby skills! **Fork** (really important!) and clone this lab.

Follow the instructions and write your code in `ruby_review.rb`.

Then run `bundle install` in your terminal to install the Gems you need and `learn` to run the tests to make sure your code is working properly.

Once you get all of your tests passing make sure that the lab is forked onto your own account. **Check this by typing `git remote -v` in the terminal - you should see your github username in this remote address.** Then push your work onto github with the following commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "passes tests"
git push
```

Then go to github and confirm the push.
